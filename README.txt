In order to run this program, put your data in a file named bin.txt, in the following format:

2             //the number of cases
10            //the size of the bins items are sorted into
6             //the number of items to sort
5 10 2 5 4 4  //a list of the weights of the items
10            //this format continues for as many cases as you have
4
3 8 2 7

Alternatively, you can put the word "random" on the first line of the bin.txt file, and the following values on the next line in order for the program to automatically generate cases.
number of cases, minBinSize, maxBinSize, minItems, maxItems, minItemSize, maxItemSize

random            //this is an example bin.txt
20 5 20 4 40 1 30
